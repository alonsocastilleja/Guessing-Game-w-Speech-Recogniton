# Guessing Game with Speech Recognition Technology

I created a guessing game during a breakout session that I attended to. The application was built using a Speech Recognition API. 
The prompt on the screen is to "guess a number between 1 and 100". You can guess the number as many times as you wish. Once you get the number right, you will win the game. If you love the game, then you also have the option to continue playing with the game reset function.

## Running the App

You can open the app by accessing the 'open with live server' option on Visual Studio Code. You can also access the app by clicking on the Netlify link!
